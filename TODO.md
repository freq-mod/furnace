# THE REAL TO-DO LIST

because I want to focus for a couple hours

- Amiga's Period Modulation not working
- Song is silent after playing an order after loop point
- Crash when opening one-column chan osc with 48 channels
- Select loaded instrument on open - rewrite because I want a setting...

once you have done all of this (maybe not the first one) and merged the two or so pending pull requests, release 0.6.1

Furnace is like alcohol...
